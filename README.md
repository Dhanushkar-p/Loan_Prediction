# Loan_Prediction

I am pleased to share my Machine Learning project, LoanSense, a web-based application designed to predict loan eligibility in real time using applicant financial and personal information.

Project Overview:

LoanSense leverages a trained classification model to evaluate key factors such as applicant income, co-applicant income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, and property area. Based on these inputs, the system predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved or rejected.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment through a Flask-based web interface.

Key Features:
Real-time loan eligibility prediction
User-friendly and responsive interface
Flask backend integration with a trained ML model
Proper handling of categorical feature encoding
Model output validation with debugging support

Technologies Used:
Python
Flask
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
